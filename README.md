> Threematrix is a proposed bridge between the Threema messenger and the Matrix protocol. It is currently a work-in-progress project and is being funded via the Prototype Fund.

## Status
This project was submitted and accepted for funding via the 11th round of the [German Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de/), which aims to fund public interest technologies under open source licenses. The funding period started on **March 1st 2022** and will last for 6 months.

First code will be committed some time during April 2022.

## Motivation
While Threema is a great messenger app for many purposes, it can become difficult to use for lager organizations. The lack of room directories or the limitation of groups only having a single admin user are hard to work around once your organization grows bigger. For users it's very hard to leave Threema behind, even though theoretically it is an Open Source project, because in reality there are very few 3rd-party-integrations of the Threema protocol. We're trying to open Threema up to the world of Matrix.

## Team
We are Fabian and Moritz, two software developers from Hamburg, Germany. We initially met during our Computer Science bachelor programme at HAW Hamburg and have been developing various freelance software projects since then.
